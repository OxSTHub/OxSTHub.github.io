# The Oxford Systems Thinking Hub

Developing and promoting cutting-edge practical Systems Thinking approaches.

## Vision
We set up the Oxford Systems Thinking Hub in Summer 2024 to promote and develop Systems Thinking across the University of Oxford. We had met many colleagues using Systems Thinking, related ideas, and methods, but without a common place to share ideas and develop new research. We felt the need for an intellectual home for Systems Thinking at Oxford; we hope the hub will be just that!

## Publications

### Systems mapping

[Systems mapping: how to build and use causal models of systems, by Pete Barbrook-Johnson and Alexandra Penn, 2022, Palgrave.](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-01919-7) - practical book outlining a range of systems mapping methods and how to use them. 

[Participatory systems mapping for complex energy policy evaluation, Barbrook-Johnson, P., & Penn, A. 2021.](https://doi.org/10.1177/1356389020976153) - paper outlining the use of participatory systems mapping (and the analysis of submaps drawn from larger maps) in policy analysis.

[Building a system-based Theory of Change using Participatory Systems Mapping, Wilkinson, H., Hills, D., Penn, A., & Barbrook-Johnson, P. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1177/1356389020980493) - paper outlining how to using systems mapping to inform a Theory of Change.

### Sensitive Intervention Points

[Sensitive intervention points: a strategic approach to climate action, Mealy, P., Barbrook-Johnson, P., Ives, MC., Srivastav, S., Hepburn, C, 2023.](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxrep/grad043) - paper outlining a relatively detailed framework for using the idea of 'sensitive intervenion points' to assess policy and intervention ideas; SIPs incorporate many systems thinking ideas.

### Modelling the energy transition

[Economic modelling fit for the demands of energy decision makers, Barbrook-Johnson, P., Mercure, JF., Sharpe, S. et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-024-01452-7) - comment piece call for new approaches to modelling for the energy transition, including systems thinking approaches.

[New economic models of energy innovation and transition](https://eeist.co.uk/eeist-reports/new-economic-models-of-energy-innovation-and-transition/) - library of case studies of new approaches to modelling the energy transition, including many quant and qual systems approaches.

Penny Mealy, Pete Barbrook-Johnson, Matthew C Ives, Sugandha Srivastav, Cameron Hepburn, Sensitive intervention points: a strategic approach to climate action, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, Volume 39, Issue 4, Winter 2023, Pages 694–710, https://doi.org/10.1093/oxrep/grad043

### Principles of complex systems

[The visual representation of complexity](https://www.cecan.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Poster-07-Joanna-Boehnert.pdf) - poster explaining the various defining characteristics of complex systems with simple visuals, examples, and learning points.
