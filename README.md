# The Oxford Systems Thinking Hub
Developing and promoting innovative and practical systems thinking approaches

## Vision
We setup the OxST Hub in 2024 to promote and develop systems thinking across the University of Oxford. We found many colleagues using systems thinking and related ideas and methods, but without a common place to share ideas and develop new research, without an intellectual home for systems thinking at Oxford. We hope the hub will be just that.
